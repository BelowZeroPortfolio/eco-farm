📤 FILES TO UPLOAD TO INFINITYFREE
=====================================

After making changes locally, upload these files to InfinityFree:

✅ REQUIRED - Upload these 2 files:
   1. yolo_service_control.php
   2. js/yolo-auto-start.js
   
   Locations on InfinityFree:
   - /htdocs/yolo_service_control.php
   - /htdocs/js/yolo-auto-start.js

📝 WHAT CHANGED:
   - Fixed session_start() order in yolo_service_control.php (prevents 500 errors)
   - Updated yolo-auto-start.js to detect ngrok and stop retrying
   - Better error handling for tunnel/ngrok setup

🎯 HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM:

1. On YOUR LAPTOP:
   ✅ Run: start_yolo_with_ngrok_debug.bat
   ✅ Keep both windows open (Flask + ngrok)
   ✅ Services should show "SUCCESS!"

2. UPLOAD FILES TO INFINITYFREE:
   ✅ Upload yolo_service_control.php
   ✅ Upload js/yolo-auto-start.js

3. On INFINITYFREE WEBSITE:
   ✅ Go to: https://sagayecofarm.infinityfreeapp.com/pest_detection.php
   ✅ Click "Open Pest Monitor" (purple button)
   ✅ You'll see a message about manual start (this is normal)
   ✅ Click OK and the detection will work!

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:

- The auto-start will detect you're using ngrok and show a one-time alert
- This is NORMAL - just click OK
- The detection will work after you click OK
- Don't click "Start Service" button (it won't work with ngrok)

🔧 IF NGROK URL CHANGES:

1. Get new URL from ngrok window
2. Update config/env.php:
   'YOLO_SERVICE_HOST' => 'your-new-url.ngrok-free.app',
3. Upload config/env.php to InfinityFree
