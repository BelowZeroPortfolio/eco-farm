# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The IoT-Enabled Farm Monitoring System is a web-based prototype application designed to demonstrate farm monitoring capabilities through sensor data visualization and pest detection alerts. The system will serve as a proof-of-concept for future integration with real IoT devices and AI-powered pest detection systems. The application supports role-based access for administrators and students/farmers, providing different levels of functionality based on user permissions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farm administrator, I want to access a comprehensive dashboard with sensor readings and pest alerts, so that I can monitor the overall farm status at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator logs into the system THEN the dashboard SHALL display summary cards showing current temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and latest pest alerts
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display charts showing sample sensor trends over time
3. WHEN new pest events occur THEN the dashboard SHALL show an alert panel with recent pest events using static sample data
4. WHEN the dashboard is accessed THEN the system SHALL display quick statistics including daily average readings and recent pest event counts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between different sections of the application, so that I can access specific functionality based on my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a navigation bar with Dashboard, Sensors, Pest Detection, Profile links for all users
2. WHEN an administrator accesses the application THEN the system SHALL additionally display User Management, Reports, and Settings links
3. WHEN a user clicks on a navigation link THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding page
4. WHEN a non-admin user attempts to access admin-only pages THEN the system SHALL restrict access and redirect appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed sensor information, so that I can monitor environmental conditions on the farm.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Sensors page THEN the system SHALL display a table listing all sensors with sample readings
2. WHEN the Sensors page loads THEN the system SHALL show charts displaying temperature, humidity, and soil moisture trends over time
3. WHEN sensor data is displayed THEN the system SHALL include status indicators showing "Online" or "Offline" status for each sensor
4. WHEN charts are rendered THEN the system SHALL use sample static data to demonstrate functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view pest detection information, so that I can respond to potential threats to crops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Pest Detection page THEN the system SHALL display a table of sample pest alerts including pest type, location, timestamp, and status
2. WHEN pest alerts are shown THEN the system SHALL include a notification panel displaying alerts for new events using static data
3. WHEN a user selects a pest event THEN the system SHALL show detailed information and suggested actions using static text
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL organize pest events by severity or timestamp

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage user accounts, so that I can control access to the farm monitoring system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the User Management page THEN the system SHALL display a list of all users with role, email, and status information
2. WHEN an administrator wants to add a user THEN the system SHALL provide functionality to create new user accounts with appropriate roles
3. WHEN an administrator selects a user THEN the system SHALL allow editing of user details and account status
4. WHEN user management actions are performed THEN the system SHALL use static functionality for prototype demonstration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate and view reports, so that I can analyze historical farm data and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Reports page THEN the system SHALL display sample sensor data reports with tables and charts for historical readings
2. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include sample pest data reports showing pest events over time
3. WHEN a user wants to export data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV or PDF download options using static export functionality
4. WHEN reports are displayed THEN the system SHALL organize data by date ranges and data types

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize system settings, so that I can personalize my experience with the farm monitoring system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Settings page THEN the system SHALL provide dashboard appearance options including theme selection and layout preferences
2. WHEN notification preferences are configured THEN the system SHALL allow users to choose types of alerts for web-based notifications
3. WHEN system settings are accessed THEN the system SHALL include placeholder sections for future IoT and AI configurations
4. WHEN settings are modified THEN the system SHALL save preferences and apply them to the user interface

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile information, so that I can maintain accurate account details and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Profile page THEN the system SHALL display current user information including name, email, and role
2. WHEN a user wants to change their password THEN the system SHALL provide a secure password management form
3. WHEN profile information is updated THEN the system SHALL validate and save the changes
4. WHEN password changes are made THEN the system SHALL enforce security requirements and confirm the change

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system, I want to implement role-based access control, so that different user types have appropriate permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL determine their role (Admin or Student/Farmer) and display appropriate navigation options
2. WHEN an Admin user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL grant access to Dashboard, Sensors, Pest Detection, User Management, Reports, Settings, and Profile pages
3. WHEN a Student/Farmer user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL grant access to Dashboard, Sensors, Pest Detection, and Profile pages only
4. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and redirect to an appropriate page

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications about important farm events, so that I can respond promptly to issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN important events occur THEN the system SHALL display web-based alerts on the dashboard using toast messages or alert panels
2. WHEN notifications are shown THEN the system SHALL use static sample data to demonstrate functionality
3. WHEN multiple alerts are present THEN the system SHALL prioritize and organize them appropriately
4. WHEN the prototype is complete THEN the system SHALL be ready for future integration of SMS and email notifications
